# *Xylella fastidiosa* (Xf) MLST phylogeny
(created 09/2020)  
Pipeline to create a phylogeny using 293 publicly available Xf MLSTs from PubMLST. Also includes *Xylella taiwanensis* as outgroup and four Colombian strains which subspecies have been confirmed.

## Get sequences.

### 1. Download concatenated Xf MLST sequences from PubMLST and unzip all downloaded sequences.

### 2. Concatenate all FASTA files into a single large FASTA file.
```bash
cat *.fasta > xf_mlst_all.cat.fasta
```
### 3. Change FASTA header to isolate ID only.
This script replaces all characters from the beginning of the line until the first ```|```occurence and replaces it with ```>```.
```bash
sed 's/[^|]*|/>/' xf293_mlst.cat.fasta > xf_mlst_all.cat.fasta
```
### 4. Add Colombian strains and *X. taiwanensis* (outgroup) to FASTA file.
```bash
cat RUBCA*.fasta >> xf_mlst_all.cat.fasta
cat xylella_taiwanensis.fasta >> xf_mlst_all.cat.fasta
```
